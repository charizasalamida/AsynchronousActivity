            <h2>Origin:</h2>

            <h2>History of Adobo</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><h3>The word adobo is derived from the Spanish word adobar, which means “marinade” or “pickling sauce.” 
                    The existence of the tangy dish was first recorded in 1613 by the Spaniard Pedro de San Buenaventura. 
                    In the dictionary he was compiling, Buenaventura listed the tart viand as “adobo de los naturales” 
                    for its similarity to Spanish and Mexican dishes that went by the same name. But while our favorite ulam’s
                    moniker boasts of a pure Spanish lineage, little else about our adobo can and should be attributed to our Hispanic conquerors.
                    According to the food historian Raymond Sokolov, the ingredients for adobo already existed in the Philippines before Ferdinand Magellan even laid eyes on our shores.
                     Because the dish’s original name was never recorded (and in a case of what Sakolov calls “lexical imperialism”), the Spanish label stuck.</h3></li>

            <h2>How to Cook Adobo</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><h3>Add the chicken pieces, vinegar, soy sauce, onion, garlic, bay leaf, peppercorns and salt to a large,
                     non-reactive bowl and refrigerate for anywhere from one to four hours to marinate.
                    Place the chicken and its marinade in a large pot. Add the water and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. 
                    Reduce heat to low and simmer for 30 to 45 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through and tender. 
                    Add water as necessary to keep the chicken from drying outRemove the chicken from its sauce, reserving the sauce, and pat dry.
                     Heat the oil in a skillet over medium-high flame and saute the chicken pieces to brown them. Remove from heat and set aside.
                    Bring the remaining sauce to a boil over medium flame and cook until somewhat reduced and thickened.
                    Toss the browned chicken pieces with the reduced sauce and serve with rice..</h3></li>
